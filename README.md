## Install

```shell
composer require brzuchal/stop-the-war
```

## Usage

Basic usage just adds general `#StopTheWar` comment, a minimum setup requirement is to include `StopTheWar` rule, as follows:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!-- phpcs.xml.dist -->
<ruleset xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="vendor/squizlabs/php_codesniffer/phpcs.xsd">
    <rule ref="StopTheWar"/>
</ruleset>
```

Results in adding stop war comment with no additional text, as follows:

```php
// #StopWar 
class MyService
{
}
```

However, if you'd like to promote any kind of extended comment define rule property called `commentExtension`, as for eg.:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!-- phpcs.xml.dist -->
<ruleset xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="vendor/squizlabs/php_codesniffer/phpcs.xsd">
    <rule ref="StopTheWar">
        <properties>
            <property name="commentExtension" value="ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ #StandWithUkraine #StopPutin"/>
        </properties>
    </rule>
</ruleset>
```

Results in adding comment in front of every class, interface, trait, enum as follows:

```php
// #StopWar ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ #StandWithUkraine #StopPutin
class MyService
{
}
```
